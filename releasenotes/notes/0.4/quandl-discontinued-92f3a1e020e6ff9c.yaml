    Data providers' usage of `Quandl` has been switched to `Nasdaq Data Link` since the
    `Quandl` python client has been discontinued and was replaced by `Nasdaq Data Link`.
    The previous `Quandl` url redirects to the new one at https://data.nasdaq.com/ .
    The userid/password and token there were preserved.
    There is no need to register again.
