  Qiskit Finance has been migrated to the `qiskit-community Github organization <https://github.com/qiskit-community>`_
  to further emphasize that it is a community-driven project.
  To reflect this change and because we are on-boarding additional code owners and maintainers,
  with this version (0.4) we have decided to *remove all deprecated* code, regardless of the time of its deprecation.
  This ensures that the new members of the development team do not have a large bulk of legacy code to maintain.

  This can mean one of two things for you as the end-user:

    #. Nothing, if you already migrated your code and no longer rely on any deprecated features.

    #. Otherwise, you need to migrate your code immediately. If you cannot do that, or want to continue using some
       of the features that were removed, you should pin your version of Qiskit Finance to 0.3.4

  For more context on the changes around Qiskit Finance and the other application projects as well as the algorithms
  library in Qiskit, be sure to read this `blog post <https://ibm.biz/BdSyNm>`_.
