   Drop pandas minimum version requirement restriction and increase yfinance minimum version
   to 0.1.70. 
   The bug that broke yfinance upon upgrading to pandas>=1.4.0 has been fixed 
   in the release version 0.1.70.
   As such, it should be safe to drop the restriction and permit newer versions of pandas.
