    Wrap all library circuits in :mod:`qiskit_finance.circuit.library` into gates such that
    when they are drawn they appear as blocks with their given name instead of the decomposition.
    For example

    .. code-block::python

        >>> from qiskit_finance.circuit.library import LogNormalDistribution
        >>> qc = LogNormalDistribution(2)
        >>> qc.draw()
             ┌───────┐
        q_0: ┤0      ├
             │  P(X) │
        q_1: ┤1      ├
             └───────┘
