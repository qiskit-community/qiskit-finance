**Qiskit Finance** is an open-source framework that contains uncertainty components for stock/securities problems,
Ising translators for portfolio optimizations and data providers to source real or random data to
finance experiments.

## Installation

We encourage installing Qiskit Finance via the pip tool (a python package manager).

```bash
pip install qiskit-finance
```

**pip** will handle all dependencies automatically and you will always install the latest
(and well-tested) version.

If you want to work on the very latest work-in-progress versions, either to try features ahead of
their official release or if you want to contribute to Finance, then you can install from source.
To do this follow the instructions in the
 [documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/finance/getting_started.html#installation).

### Creating Your First Finance Programming Experiment in Qiskit

Now that Qiskit Finance is installed, it's time to begin working with the finance module.
Let's try an experiment using Amplitude Estimation algorithm to
evaluate a fixed income asset with uncertain interest rates.

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit import BasicAer
from qiskit.algorithms import AmplitudeEstimation
from qiskit_finance.circuit.library import NormalDistribution
from qiskit_finance.applications import FixedIncomePricing

# Create a suitable multivariate distribution
num_qubits = [2, 2]
bounds = [(0, 0.12), (0, 0.24)]
mvnd = NormalDistribution(
    num_qubits, mu=[0.12, 0.24], sigma=0.01 * np.eye(2), bounds=bounds
)

# Create fixed income component
fixed_income = FixedIncomePricing(
    num_qubits,
    np.eye(2),
    np.zeros(2),
    cash_flow=[1.0, 2.0],
    rescaling_factor=0.125,
    bounds=bounds,
    uncertainty_model=mvnd,
)

# the FixedIncomeExpectedValue provides us with the necessary rescalings

# create the A operator for amplitude estimation
problem = fixed_income.to_estimation_problem()

# Set number of evaluation qubits (samples)
num_eval_qubits = 5

# Construct and run amplitude estimation
q_i = BasicAer.get_backend("statevector_simulator")
algo = AmplitudeEstimation(num_eval_qubits=num_eval_qubits, quantum_instance=q_i)
result = algo.estimate(problem)

print(f"Estimated value:\t{fixed_income.interpret(result):.4f}")
print(f"Probability:    \t{result.max_probability:.4f}")
```
When running the above the estimated value result should be 2.46 and probability 0.8487.

### Further examples

Learning path notebooks may be found in the
[finance tutorials](https://qiskit.org/documentation/finance/tutorials/index.html) section
of the documentation and are a great place to start.
