Installation
============

Qiskit Finance depends on Qiskit, which has its own
`installation instructions <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install>`__ detailing the
installation options and its supported environments/platforms. You should refer to
that first. Then the information here can be followed which focuses on the additional installation
specific to Qiskit Finance.

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Start locally

        The simplest way to get started is to follow the installation guide for Qiskit `here <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install>`__

        In your virtual environment, where you installed Qiskit, install ``qiskit-finance`` as follows:

        .. code:: sh

            pip install qiskit-finance

        .. note::

            As Qiskit Finance depends on Qiskit, you can though simply install it into your
            environment, as above, and pip will automatically install a compatible version of Qiskit
            if one is not already installed.

    .. tab-item:: Install from source

       Installing Qiskit Finance from source allows you to access the most recently
       updated version under development instead of using the version in the Python Package
       Index (PyPI) repository. This will give you the ability to inspect and extend
       the latest version of the Qiskit Finance code more efficiently.

       Since Qiskit Finance depends on Qiskit, and its latest changes may require new or changed
       features of Qiskit, you should first follow Qiskit's `"Install from source"` instructions
      `here <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install-qiskit-source>`__

          <h2>Installing Qiskit Finance from Source</h2>

       Using the same development environment that you installed Qiskit in you are ready to install
       Qiskit Finance.

       1. Clone the Qiskit Finance repository.

          .. code:: sh

             git clone https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-finance.git

       2. Cloning the repository creates a local folder called ``qiskit-finance``.

          .. code:: sh

             cd qiskit-finance

       3. If you want to run tests or linting checks, install the developer requirements.

          .. code:: sh

             pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

       4. Install ``qiskit-finance``.

          .. code:: sh

             pip install .

       If you want to install it in editable mode, meaning that code changes to the
       project don't require a reinstall to be applied, you can do this with:

       .. code:: sh

          pip install -e .
